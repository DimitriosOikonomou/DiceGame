This project was assigned to me, Oikonomou Dimitrios, by my professor, Ioannis Mauridis, for my 4th year university course in Blockchain.

It implements a simple betting dice game using an Ethereum contract for the backend and a simple web interface for the front end.

There be bugs! Tread carefully...
